# WestWave Backend

This is the backend for the WestWave app. It provides real-time chat functionality using WebSocket and Socket.IO, and serves as the API server.

## Running Locally

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. The server will run at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Deploying to Render

1. Push the project to a GitHub repository.
2. Create a new Web Service on Render.
3. Select this repository and follow the instructions to deploy.

The WebSocket server will work automatically once deployed.
